# Instructions

On this project, a junior developer started to implement a tag filter system on a site that presents some cooking recipes.

The developer has gone on vacation, so you will have to take over and continue his work.

Currently, the filter system is not working. You will try to improve/redo this filter system.

Preliminary Tasks :

- add one recipe in the recipe database (RecipeData.ts)
- add 2 new tags and affect these tags to the recipes (it could be any type of tag)

Features :

- add a feature to allow to filter recipes by clicking on a tag (the behavior must work if you click on a menu tag or a recipe tag).
- display the selected tags in the header and hide those that are not selected
- if you click on the tag in the header, it will remove the tag from the filter
- add the possibility to select several tags at the same time (the displayed recipes should contain all the selected tags)

To develop this feature you can use a state, a context or any other solution you like.

Bonus :

- You can do whatever you want to improve the experience on this little app.
